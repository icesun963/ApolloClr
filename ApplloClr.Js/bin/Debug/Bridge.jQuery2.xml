        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Accepts">
            <summary>
            The content type sent in the request header that tells the server what kind of response it will accept in return.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Async">
            <summary>
            By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.BeforeSend">
            <summary>
            A pre-request callback function that can be used to modify the jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHTTPRequest) object before it is sent. Use this to set custom headers, etc. The jqXHR and settings objects are passed as arguments. This is an Ajax Event. Returning false in the beforeSend function will cancel the request.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Cache">
            <summary>
            If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser. Note: Setting cache to false will only work correctly with HEAD and GET requests. It works by appending "_={timestamp}" to the GET parameters. The parameter is not needed for other types of requests, except in IE8 when a POST is made to a URL that has already been requested by a GET.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Complete">
            <summary>
            A function to be called when the request finishes (after success and error callbacks are executed). The function gets passed two arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHTTPRequest) object and a string categorizing the status of the request ("success", "notmodified", "error", "timeout", "abort", or "parsererror").
            </summary>

        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.CompleteArray">
            <summary>
            A function to be called when the request finishes (after success and error callbacks are executed). The function gets passed two arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHTTPRequest) object and a string categorizing the status of the request ("success", "notmodified", "error", "timeout", "abort", or "parsererror").

        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Contents">
            <summary>
            An object of string/regular-expression pairs that determine how jQuery will parse the response, given its content type.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.ContentType">
            <summary>
            When sending data to the server, use this content type. Default is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8", which is fine for most cases. If you explicitly pass in a content-type to $.ajax(), then it is always sent to the server (even if no data is sent). The W3C XMLHttpRequest specification dictates that the charset is always UTF-8; specifying another charset will not force the browser to change the encoding.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Context">
            <summary>
            This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks. By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax).
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Converters">
            <summary>
            An object containing dataType-to-dataType converters. Each converter's value is a function that returns the transformed value of the response.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.CrossDomain">
            <summary>
            If you wish to force a crossDomain request (such as JSONP) on the same domain, set the value of crossDomain to true. This allows, for example, server-side redirection to another domain.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Data">
            <summary>
            Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs. If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting (described below).

        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.DataFilter">
            <summary>
            A function to be used to handle the raw response data of XMLHttpRequest.This is a pre-filtering function to sanitize the response. You should return the sanitized data. The function accepts two arguments: The raw data returned from the server and the 'dataType' parameter.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.DataType">
            <summary>
            The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4 JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the script, and anything else will be returned as a string). (xml, json, script, or html)
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Error">
            <summary>
            A function to be called if the request fails. The function receives three arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHttpRequest) object, a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object, if one occurred. Possible values for the second argument (besides null) are "timeout", "error", "abort", and "parsererror". When an HTTP error occurs, errorThrown receives the textual portion of the HTTP status, such as "Not Found" or "Internal Server Error."
            </summary>

        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Global">
            <summary>
            Whether to trigger global Ajax event handlers for this request. The default is true. Set to false to prevent the global handlers like ajaxStart or ajaxStop from being triggered. This can be used to control various Ajax Events.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Headers">
            <summary>
            An object of additional header key/value pairs to send along with requests using the XMLHttpRequest transport. The header X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest is always added, but its default XMLHttpRequest value can be changed here. Values in the headers setting can also be overwritten from within the beforeSend function.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.IfModified">
            <summary>
            Allow the request to be successful only if the response has changed since the last request. This is done by checking the Last-Modified header. Default value is false, ignoring the header. In jQuery 1.4 this technique also checks the 'etag' specified by the server to catch unmodified data.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.IsLocal">
            <summary>
            Allow the current environment to be recognized as "local," (e.g. the filesystem), even if jQuery does not recognize it as such by default. The following protocols are currently recognized as local: file, *-extension, and widget. If the isLocal setting needs modification, it is recommended to do so once in the $.ajaxSetup() method.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.JsonP">
            <summary>
            Override the callback function name in a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of 'callback' in the 'callback=?' part of the query string in the url. So {jsonp:'onJSONPLoad'} would result in 'onJSONPLoad=?' passed to the server.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.JsonpCallback">
            <summary>
            Specify the callback function name for a JSONP request. This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. It is preferable to let jQuery generate a unique name as it'll make it easier to manage the requests and provide callbacks and error handling. You may want to specify the callback when you want to enable better browser caching of GET requests.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.JsonpCallbackFn">
            <summary>
            Specify the callback function name for a JSONP request. This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. It is preferable to let jQuery generate a unique name as it'll make it easier to manage the requests and provide callbacks and error handling. You may want to specify the callback when you want to enable better browser caching of GET requests.

        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.ProcessData">
            <summary>
            By default, data passed in to the data option as an object (technically, anything other than a string) will be processed and transformed into a query string, fitting to the default content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". If you want to send a DOMDocument, or other non-processed data, set this option to false.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.ScriptCharset">
            <summary>
            Only applies when the "script" transport is used (e.g., cross-domain requests with "jsonp" or "script" dataType and "GET" type). Sets the charset attribute on the script tag used in the request. Used when the character set on the local page is not the same as the one on the remote script.

        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Success">
            <summary>
            A function to be called if the request succeeds. The function gets passed three arguments: The data returned from the server, formatted according to the dataType parameter; a string describing the status; and the jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHttpRequest) object.
            </summary>

        </member>
        <member name="P:Bridge.jQuery2.AjaxOptions.Timeout">
            <summary>
            Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request. This will override any global timeout set with $.ajaxSetup(). The timeout period starts at the point the $.ajax call is made; if several other requests are in progress and the browser has no connections available, it is possible for a request to time out before it can be sent.
            </summary>

             Creates an object that handles the actual transmission of Ajax data.
             A transport is an object that provides two methods, send and abort, that are used internally by $.ajax() to issue requests. A transport is the most advanced way to enhance $.ajax() and should be used only as a last resort when prefilters and converters are insufficient.
             Since each request requires its own transport object instance, transports cannot be registered directly. Therefore, you should provide a function that returns a transport instead.
             Transports factories are registered using $.ajaxTransport(). A typical registration looks like this:
            
             $.ajaxTransport(function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
                 if( /* transportCanHandleRequest */ ) {

                 headers is an object of (key-value) request headers that the transport can transmit if it supports it
                 completeCallback is the callback used to notify ajax of the completion of the request

                 statusText is the statusText of the response.
                 responses (Optional) is An object containing dataType/value that contains the response in all the formats the transport could provide (for instance, a native XMLHttpRequest object would set reponses to { xml: XMLData, text: textData } for a response that is an XML document)

            The Deferred object is a chainable utility object created by calling the jQuery.Deferred() method. It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.
            The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.

             In a keypress event, the Unicode value of the key pressed is stored in either the keyCode or charCode property, never both. If the key pressed generates a character (e.g. 'a'), charCode is set to the code of that character, respecting the letter case. (i.e. charCode takes into account whether the shift key is held down). Otherwise, the code of the pressed key is stored in keyCode.
            
             keyCode is always set in the keydown and keyup events. In these cases, charCode is never set.
            
             To get the code of the key regardless of whether it was stored in keyCode or charCode, query the which property.
            
             Characters entered through an IME do not register through keyCode or charCode.

            <summary>
            The key value of the key represented by the event. If the value has a printed representation, this attribute's value is the same as the char attribute. Otherwise, it's one of the key value strings specified in {{anch("Key values")}}. If the key can't be identified, this is the string "Unidentified". See key names for the detail. In Firefox 26 this has a valid string for non-printable characters, and some printable characters (e.g. Tab, Enter). For regular characters it returns only "MozPrintableKey". charCode works and returns the character code.

             This property returns an integer value indicating the button that changed state.
            
                    0 for standard "click"; this is usually the left button for a right-handed mouse and right button for a left-handed mouse.
                    1 for middle button; this is usually a click on the scroll wheel's button.
                    2 for right button; this is usually a right-click on a right-handed mouse and left-click on a left-handed mouse.
            
             Note: This convention is not followed in Internet Explorer prior to version 9: See QuirksMode for details (http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_properties.html#button).
            
             Notes
            
             Because mouse clicks are frequently intercepted by the user interface, it may be difficult to detect buttons other than those for a standard mouse click (usually the left button) in some circumstances.
            
             Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device so that if an event's button property is zero, it may not have been caused by the button that is physically left–most on the pointing device; however, it should behave as if the left button was clicked in the standard button layout.
